# ![Logotipo da AluraBooks](./images/Logo.svg) AluraBooks
A simple web project with responsive layouts and a mobile-first approach.

## Description
The web page created for this project has the purpose of being used by a fictitious store called AluraBooks. Their main goal would be to sell different kinds of e-books pertaining to technology and other similar topics. Even though it has only one page, the website boasts a wide variety of sections, such as:

- a header with an interactive menu;
- a banner containing a search bar;
- responsive swipers along with custom cards;
- a list of recently visited topics;
- a simple form for typing in your email;
- a footer with links and references;

## What I've learned
This has been an extremely fruitful project to work on during the last few weeks. I'm now a lot more knowledgeable about some best practices used by actual developers and programmers when creating applications that are geared towards multiple kinds of devices. Some of the skills I've been able to hone include:

- applying mobile-first approaches to a project;
- adding a responsive swiper with SwiperJS;
- coding CSS styles based on a Figma template;
- creating structures and layouts with flexbox;
- selecting and refining media queries;
